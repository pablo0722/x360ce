	/// <remarks>
	/// If data has the REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, or REG_EXPAND_SZ type, the string
	/// may not have been stored with the proper terminating null characters.
	/// Therefore, when reading a string from the registry, you must ensure that
	/// the string is properly terminated before using it; otherwise, it may
	/// overwrite a buffer. (Note that REG_MULTI_SZ strings should have two
	/// terminating null characters.)
	///
	/// When writing a string to the registry, you must specify the length of the
	/// string, including the terminating null character (\0). A common error is
	/// to use the strlen function to determine the length of the string, but to
	/// forget that strlen returns only the number of characters in the string,
	/// not including the terminating null. Therefore, the length of the string
	/// should be calculated as follows: strlen( string ) + 1
	///
	/// A REG_MULTI_SZ string ends with a string of length 0. Therefore, it is
	/// not possible to include a zero-length string in the sequence. An empty
	/// sequence would be defined as follows: \0.
